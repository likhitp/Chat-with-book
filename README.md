# Chat with Your Books 

Welcome to **Chat with Your Books**! This project allows you to have interactive conversations with your PDFs. Upload your documents, and start asking questionsâ€”this app will help you dive deep into your content, making your reading and research more engaging and interactive.

## Features

- **Multiple PDF Support**: Upload multiple PDFs and engage with the content across all of them simultaneously.
- **Conversational AI**: Ask questions and receive answers in a chat format, making document interaction seamless and intuitive.
- **Smart Memory**: The app remembers your conversation history, allowing for continuous and coherent dialogue.
- **Powered by Advanced Language Models**: Utilize either OpenAI's or Hugging Face's state-of-the-art language models for generating responses.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Your PDFs**: Use the sidebar to upload one or more PDF documents.
2. **Process the Documents**: Click on the "Process" button to extract and analyze the text from your PDFs.
3. **Ask Questions**: Once the documents are processed, type in your questions in the text input field at the top.
4. **Interactive Responses**: The app responds to your questions based on the content of the uploaded PDFs, and the conversation history is maintained for context.
